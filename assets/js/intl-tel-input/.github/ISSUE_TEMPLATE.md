IMPORTANT: since v14 we have removed the jQuery dependency. See the readme for how to initialise and use the plugin with pure JavaScript. If you want to stick with the jQuery version, stick with v13.

IMPORTANT: please note that the auto-format feature (AKA format-as-you-type) was removed in v8. Please do not open any new issues about this topic.

IMPORTANT: we use libphonenumber for formatting and validation - if your issue relates to one of these things, please check their test site first and if you see the problem there please file an issue with them instead.
