  }}&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; UBQFIT Inc. (“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
  class="ubqfittext"&gt; UB&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;FIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”) is
  committed to</p><p> respecting the privacy of all persons using the <a href="http://ubqfit.com/"
  title="http://ubqfit.com/">http://ubqfit.com/</a> website (the</p><p> “&lt;strong&gt;Site&lt;/strong&gt;”),
  the UBQFIT mobile application (the “ &lt;strong&gt;App&lt;/strong&gt;”) and the</p><p>
  associated UBQFIT service (collectively, the Site, the App and the services shall
  be referred to</p><p> herein as the “ &lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt;”). This
  Privacy Policy describes the information gathering</p><p> and dissemination practices
  for the Service. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; In order to use the Site, you are not
  required to provide any personally identifiable information.</p><p> However, if
  you do provide any such information through the Site, this Privacy Policy will apply
  to</p><p> UBQFIT’s use of such information. If you register as a member on the Service,
  UBQFIT will request that</p><p> you provide certain limited personal information
  and you may provide certain personal information</p><p> through and in connection
  with your use of the Service. The terms of this Privacy Policy will apply to</p><p>
  UBQFIT’s handling of all such information. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  1. &lt;u&gt;Collection and Use of Personal Information&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  A. &lt;u&gt;Account Information&lt;/u&gt;. When you register as a user with the
  Service, we will ask you to</p><p> provide us with your personal information, including
  as applicable your name, e-mail address, physical</p><p> address, gender and birth
  date. You can opt whether or not to provide additional personal information</p><p>
  when establishing your account, such as personal preferences and likes and dislikes
  relating to</p><p> fitness and exercise activities. We may also receive personal
  information from other websites with</p><p> which we partner or link, such as Facebook
  or other social networks, if you register through those</p><p> services. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  B. &lt;u&gt;Usage Data&lt;/u&gt;. We may collect and analyze information about your
  use of the Site and Service</p><p> for the purposes of determining your compliance
  with the UBQFIT Terms of Use. We may also collect and</p><p> analyze such information
  for statistical purposes. This information may be analyzed and/or aggregated</p><p>
  to determine appropriate modifications and enhancements to the Site or Service or
  to customize your</p><p> personal experience, including providing search results
  and information we believe appropriate based</p><p> on your information. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  C. &lt;u&gt;Use of IP Addresses&lt;/u&gt;. UBQFIT may use your IP address to help
  diagnose problems with our</p><p> servers and to administer our service. Your IP
  address may be used with the IP addresses of other</p><p> members to gather broad
  demographic information. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; D. &lt;u&gt;Use of Cookies&lt;/u&gt;.
  We or our business partners may use “cookies” in connection with the Site</p><p>
  and Service. Cookies are pieces of code that a Web site places on an individual''s
  hard drive for</p><p> record-keeping purpose and/or to enhance a user’s experience.
  You may adjust your computer to disallow</p><p> the storing of cookies. However,
  certain aspects of our Site and Service may not function properly if</p><p> cookies
  are disabled. We are not responsible for the use of cookies by other Web sites that
  are</p><p> accessed through us, including advertisers or Instructors. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  E. &lt;u&gt;Location Information&lt;/u&gt;. When you use the Services, we may collect
  certain location</p><p> information from you. This information may consist of the
  location information you affirmatively</p><p> provide in connection with becoming
  a user or when registering for classes or other wellness</p><p> activities. Your
  location information may also be collected automatically from your device. This</p><p>
  location information may include your longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates.
  If you do not agree to</p><p> this collection, you can change your privacy preferences
  on your device, but some functionality of the</p><p> Services may be disabled. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  F. &lt;u&gt;Information We Get From Others&lt;/u&gt;. We may get information about
  you from other sources. We</p><p> may add this to information we get from the Services.
  If you register using a third party</p><p> authenticator login (such as Facebook),
  you authorize us to access certain account information from</p><p> the third party
  authenticator, such as your public profile (consistent with the third party’s privacy</p><p>
  policy and your privacy settings related thereto), email address, interests, “likes,”
  gender,</p><p> birthday, education history, work history, interests, current city,
  photos, videos, personal</p><p> description, friend list, and other information
  from your use of the third party service. If you are</p><p> using the Service as
  part of any offering from your employer, we may also receive certain information</p><p>
  about you from your employer. Information we get from others (including third party
  data companies)</p><p> may be combined with information you give us. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  G. &lt;u&gt;Payment Information&lt;/u&gt;. You may also make payments using the
  third-party payment services</p><p> provider, such as Stripe, made available through
  the Service. In connection with making payments, You</p><p> may be required to provide
  additional information to facilitate the transaction, such a bank account</p><p>
  or credit card information. UBQFIT does not store or use this payment information
  in anyway other than</p><p> to relay the information to the third-party payment
  services provider to facilitate the transfer of</p><p> funds. The third-party payment
  services provider’s use of such information shall be governed by its</p><p> applicable
  terms of services and/or privacy policy. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; H. &lt;u&gt;Health
  Data; Recorded Lessons&lt;/u&gt;. As a part of the Service, you will be offered
  the option of</p><p> having a private lesson at full price (a “&lt;strong&gt;Private
  Lesson&lt;/strong&gt;”) or a public lesson for a</p><p> reduced fee (a “ &lt;strong&gt;Public
  Lesson&lt;/strong&gt;”). &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class="list-pad"&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  a. &lt;u&gt;Public Lessons&lt;/u&gt;. A livestream of a Public Lesson (a “ &lt;strong&gt;Livestream&lt;/strong&gt;”)
  may</p><p> be available for other users of the Service to watch, and a recording
  (a</p><p> “&lt;strong&gt;Recording&lt;/strong&gt;”) of such Livestream may be available
  for users of the Service to play</p><p> at any time. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you
  opt into a Public Lesson, you are releasing UBQFIT from any and all</p><p> liability
  arising from federal, state, or international privacy laws (including without limitation</p><p>
  HIPAA) in any way relating to the Livestream or Recording or the inclusion of Metrics
  in the</p><p> Livestream or Recording (as further described below). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
  Recordings will remain available</p><p> only to users of the Service. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  b. &lt;u&gt;Health Data&lt;/u&gt;. You may opt into having certain of your health-related
  Metrics captured by</p><p> your device(s) using the Service during a lesson. If
  you are an Apple Watch user then such metrics will be captures using the Apple Healthkit.
  “&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;” means any or all of the</p><p> following:
  heartrate (beats per minute), steps, weight, or calories burned. Metrics may be
  embedded</p><p> in a Livestream or Recording if you opt into a Public Lesson and
  may be alongside certain</p><p> information entered by you, such as your username,
  weight, age, or self-assessed fitness level. You</p><p> can choose not to provide
  the Metrics, in which case the Metrics will not be included in your</p><p> Livestream
  or Recording of a Public Lesson. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  2. Use and Disclosure of Information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; A. &lt;u&gt;Provision
  of Goods and Services&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class="list-pad"&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  a. UBQFIT will use your personal information to: &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class="list-pad"&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  i. operate, maintain, and improve our App, Site and Services. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  ii. respond to comments and questions and provide customer service. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  iii. send information including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates,
  security</p><p> alerts, and support and administrative messages. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  iv. communicate about promotions, upcoming events, and other news about products
  and services</p><p> offered by us and our selected partners. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  v. link or combine user information with other personal information. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  vi. protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal
  activity. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; vii. customize and tailor content and advertising
  to specific audiences or individuals. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; viii. provide and
  deliver products and services customers request. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; ix.
  facilitate purchase transactions. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  B. &lt;u&gt;Your Employer&lt;/u&gt;. If you are using the Service as part of any
  offering from your employer, we</p><p> may share information regarding your use
  of the Service with your employer. Such information may</p><p> include, but is not
  limited to attendance or participation in specific service offerings and</p><p>
  utilization rates. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; C. &lt;u&gt;Targeted Advertising.&lt;/u&gt;
  We may customize advertisements on the Service based upon: (i) the</p><p> information
  that you knowingly provide us (including age, gender, stated fitness and lifestyle</p><p>
  interests and other information in your profile); (ii) geographic location which
  we may determine</p><p> through your use of the Service; (iii) data we receive from
  third parties and/or (iv) your behavior</p><p> while using the Service. We may engage
  a third-party vendor who, through the use of cookies and your</p><p> use of the
  Service, determines your interests and targets advertisements and promotions based
  on those</p><p> interests. This vendor may target advertisements not only on the
  Service but on other web sites with</p><p> which the vendor has a relationship.
  &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; D. &lt;u&gt;Other Uses&lt;/u&gt;. We may also: &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  a. Disclose your personal information to companies who work on behalf of or with
  UBQFIT to provide</p><p> the Service. Unless we tell you differently, these companies
  do not have any right to use the personal</p><p> information we provide to them
  beyond what is necessary to assist us. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; b. Enhance or
  merge the personal information collected by us with data received from third parties.</p><p>&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  c. Release personal information and/or other information if required to do so by
  law, or in the</p><p> good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply
  with state, federal or international laws or</p><p> respond to a court order, subpoena,
  or search warrant. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; d. Disclose personal information and/or
  other information about you that we believe, in good faith,</p><p> is appropriate
  or necessary to enforce our agreements, take precautions against liability, to</p><p>
  investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations,
  to assist government</p><p> enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity
  of the Site or Service, and protect the</p><p> rights, property, or personal safety
  of UBQFIT, our users or others. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; 3. &lt;u&gt;Other
  Terms&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; A. &lt;u&gt;Profiles/Public
  Spaces&lt;/u&gt;. Information you provide for your profile page may be accessed
  and</p><p> viewed publicly unless you choose otherwise through the Service. Only
  your legal name is required to</p><p> be shown publicly on your profile page. It
  is your option to show or not show the other profile</p><p> information publicly
  on your profile page. Please remember that any information disclosed in publicly</p><p>
  accessible areas of the Service will be disclosed to third-parties and become public
  information.</p><p> UBQFIT cannot control and shall have no liability for third-party
  uses of information you make</p><p> available in publicly accessible areas of the
  Service. As with any social networking service, you</p><p> should exercise caution
  when deciding to disclose your personal or proprietary information. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  B. &lt;u&gt;Usage of UBQFIT by Children&lt;/u&gt;. UBQFIT does not knowingly allow
  children under the age of</p><p> thirteen (13) to sign up for an account on the
  Service or to otherwise disclose any of their personal</p><p> information to us.
  If you are under 13 years old, please do not use or access our Service. We do not</p><p>
  intend to collect information about children under the age of 13. If we later obtain
  actual knowledge</p><p> that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps
  to remove that user’s information from our</p><p> systems. If you are the parent
  or guardian of a child under 13 whom you believe has disclosed personal</p><p> information
  to us, please contact us at &lt;a href="mailto:info@UBQFIT.com" target="_blank"&gt;</p><p>
  info@UBQFIT.com&lt;/a&gt; so that we may delete and remove the child’s information
  from our systems. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; C. &lt;u&gt;Choice/Opt-Out&lt;/u&gt;.
  We may provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain</p><p> communications
  from us and our business partners during registration or otherwise from time to
  time as</p><p> you use the Service. Even if you opt out of such communications,
  however, we reserve the right to send</p><p> you e-mail and other communications
  to disclose maintenance and other service-related issues</p><p> applicable to the
  Site or the Service. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; D. &lt;u&gt;User Information Correction/Update&lt;/u&gt;.
  You may access, update and/or correct your account</p><p> information at any time
  by clicking the “edit my profile” button on your profile page. You may need to</p><p>
  supply certain information so that we can try to verify that you have authority
  to modify this</p><p> information. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; E. &lt;u&gt;Third-Party
  Sites&lt;/u&gt;. The Site or Service may contain links to other Internet sites.
  We have</p><p> no responsibility for the privacy practices of other Web sites, including
  the Web sites of</p><p> Instructors, even if linked through to our Service. Our
  privacy policies do not apply to your use of</p><p> such sites or information you
  may provide on such sites. We encourage you to review the privacy</p><p> policies
  of any web site you may access through the Site or Service. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  F. &lt;u&gt;Legal Requirements&lt;/u&gt;. We are committed to protecting your privacy
  as described in this</p><p> policy while also fulfilling our responsibility to uphold
  all applicable laws and regulations. Due to</p><p> potential legal requirements
  and other possible circumstances, we cannot ensure that all of your</p><p> private
  communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed
  or</p><p> accessed in ways not otherwise described in this policy. We may be compelled
  under law to disclose</p><p> information to government or third parties under certain
  circumstances or third parties may unlawfully</p><p> intercept or access transmissions
  or private communications. Further, we can, and you hereby authorize</p><p> us to,
  disclose any information to law enforcement or other government officials that we,
  in our sole</p><p> discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in compliance with
  the law. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; G. &lt;u&gt;Sale of Company or Assets&lt;/u&gt;.
  In the event that all or part of UBQFIT is acquired by or</p><p> merged with a third
  party entity, you agree that we may transfer or assign the information we have</p><p>
  collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, or other change of control.
  In the unlikely</p><p> event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
  or assignment for the benefit of</p><p> creditors, or the application of laws or
  equitable principles affecting creditors'' rights generally,</p><p> we may not be
  able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
  &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; H. &lt;u&gt;International Users&lt;/u&gt;. The Site and
  Service is hosted in the United States. If you are</p><p> accessing the Site from
  outside the United States, please be advised that through your continued use</p><p>
  of the Site or Service, which is governed by U.S. law and this Privacy Policy, you
  are transferring</p><p> your personal information to the United States and you consent
  to that transfer. Without limiting the</p><p> generality of the foregoing, UBQFIT
  is based within the United States and does not offer goods or</p><p> services to
  individuals in the European Union or monitor behavior of individuals within the
  European</p><p> Union. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class="list-pad"&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; a. &lt;u&gt;European Union Resident Rights&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;div
  class="list-pad"&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; i. Notwithstanding the above, if you are accessing
  the site from the European Union, you have</p><p> the following data protection
  rights: &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; 1. You may access, correct, update or request
  deletion of your personal information at any time</p><p> by contacting us using
  the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” section below. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  2. You may object to our processing your personal information, ask us to restrict
  processing of</p><p> your personal information or request portability of your personal
  information. You can exercise</p><p> these rights by contacting us using the contact
  details below. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; 3. You have the right opt-out of any marketing
  communications we send to you at any time. You</p><p> may exercise this right by
  clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the marketing emails that we send</p><p> to
  you. Or you may reply to any of our marketing emails requesting to be removed from
  our email</p><p> database. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; 4. If we have previously collected
  and processed your personal information with your consent,</p><p> you can withdraw
  this consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness</p><p>
  of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing
  of your</p><p> personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
  other than consent. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; 5. You have the right to complain
  to a data protection authority about our collection and use of</p><p> your personal
  information. For more information, contact your local data protection authority.</p><p>&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  ii. We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise
  their data</p><p> protection rights in accordance with applicable laws. We reserve
  the right to keep any information</p><p> in our archives that we deem necessary
  to comply with our legal obligations. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  b. For users accessing the site from the European Union, we are the data controller
  for the</p><p> processing of personal information under applicable law. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;
  I. &lt;u&gt;Security&lt;/u&gt;. We will use reasonable security measures on the
  Site and Service to help protect</p><p> against the loss, misuse and alteration
  of the personal information under our control. Additionally,</p><p> UBQFIT takes
  reasonable steps to ensure that our third party business partners, including our
  hosting</p><p> partners, provide sufficient protection for personal information.
  &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; J. &lt;u&gt;Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy&lt;/u&gt;.
  This Privacy Policy may be revised</p><p> periodically by UBQFIT, as reflected by
  the “last modified” date above. Please revisit this page to</p><p> stay aware of
  any changes. Material amendments to this Privacy Policy shall be communicated to
  you at</p><p> the time you log into the Site or Service. Your continued use of the
  Site or Service constitutes your</p><p> agreement to this Privacy Policy and any
  future revisions. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; K. &lt;u&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/u&gt;.
  This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms of Use, which</p><p>
  includes provisions such as limitations on damages, disclaimers of warranty, and
  application of the</p><p> internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard
  to its conflict of laws provisions. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt; L. &lt;u&gt;Contact
  Us&lt;/u&gt;. We hope to create a Site and Service that are beneficial to you and
  that you</p><p> trust. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or the
  information handling practices of</p><p> UBQFIT, please contact us at &lt;a href="mailto:info@UBQFIT.com"
