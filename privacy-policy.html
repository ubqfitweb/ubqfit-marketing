                  when establishing your account, such as personal preferences and likes and dislikes relating to
                  fitness and exercise activities. We may also receive personal information from other websites with
                  which we partner or link, such as Facebook or other social networks, if you register through those
                  services. </p>
                <p> B. <u>Usage Data</u>. We may collect and analyze information about your use of the Site and Service
                  for the purposes of determining your compliance with the UBQFIT Terms of Use. We may also collect and
                  analyze such information for statistical purposes. This information may be analyzed and/or aggregated
                  to determine appropriate modifications and enhancements to the Site or Service or to customize your

                <p> D. <u>Use of Cookies</u>. We or our business partners may use “cookies” in connection with the Site

                  the storing of cookies. However, certain aspects of our Site and Service may not function properly if
                  cookies are disabled. We are not responsible for the use of cookies by other Web sites that are

                  activities. Your location information may also be collected automatically from your device. This

                <p> F. <u>Information We Get From Others</u>. We may get information about you from other sources. We
                  may add this to information we get from the Services. If you register using a third party

                  birthday, education history, work history, interests, current city, photos, videos, personal
                  description, friend list, and other information from your use of the third party service. If you are
                  using the Service as part of any offering from your employer, we may also receive certain information

                  may be combined with information you give us. </p>
                <p> G. <u>Payment Information</u>. You may also make payments using the third-party payment services

                  to relay the information to the third-party payment services provider to facilitate the transfer of
                  funds. The third-party payment services provider’s use of such information shall be governed by its
                  applicable terms of services and/or privacy policy. </p>
                <p> H. <u>Health Data; Recorded Lessons</u>. As a part of the Service, you will be offered the option of
                  having a private lesson at full price (a “<strong>Private Lesson</strong>”) or a public lesson for a

                <div class="list-pad">
                  <p> a. <u>Public Lessons</u>. A livestream of a Public Lesson (a “ <strong>Livestream</strong>”) may
                    be available for other users of the Service to watch, and a recording (a
                    “<strong>Recording</strong>”) of such Livestream may be available for users of the Service to play

                    liability arising from federal, state, or international privacy laws (including without limitation
                    HIPAA) in any way relating to the Livestream or Recording or the inclusion of Metrics in the
                    Livestream or Recording (as further described below). <br> <br> Recordings will remain available
                    only to users of the Service. </p>
                  <p> b. <u>Health Data</u>. You may opt into having certain of your health-related Metrics captured by
                    your device(s) using the Service during a lesson. If you are an Apple Watch user then such metrics will be captures using the Apple Healthkit. “<strong>Metrics</strong>” means any or all of the

                    in a Livestream or Recording if you opt into a Public Lesson and may be alongside certain
                    information entered by you, such as your username, weight, age, or self-assessed fitness level. You
                    can choose not to provide the Metrics, in which case the Metrics will not be included in your
                    Livestream or Recording of a Public Lesson. </p>

                  information to government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully
