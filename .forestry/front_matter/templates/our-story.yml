    <p>

     Ellie grew up living all over the world, from the Middle East to Asia and Canada. Throughout it all,

     her family mantra stayed consistent: succeeding professionally meant being happy with your life. </p>

    </p>

    <p>

     She

     studied economics in Canada, worked in real estate, consulted at Deloitte, earned her MBA from

     Columbia Business School and wound up in Investment Banking and Trading at Morgan Stanley on Wall

     Street. But while her career flourished during those years, she didn’t feel personally fulfilled. She

     had compromised her core values—family, friends, community and most importantly her health and

     fitness—while work engulfed her life.

    </p>

    <p>

     After more than a decade of that lifestyle, she changed tracks

     and began pursuing a healthier, happier life and raising a family. One marriage and two kids later,

     she realized once again just how hard it was to commit to being fit and healthy: it’s always a battle

     to self-motivate and commit the necessary time to the things that really matter. Ellie sought out a

     solution for over a year, and that was UBQFIT.

    </p>

    <p>

     UBQFIT is a barrier-smashing community of like-minded people interested in enhancing their health and

     fitness while supporting others to do the same. It’s a social club, a personal motivator and a virtual

     real-time. For trainers, UBQFIT creates new opportunities to find clients and fill in gaps in their

     schedules, transcending the confines of physical gyms and geographical limitations.

    </p>

     engaging for people of all strengths, budgets and experience. This is fitness without walls—your own
